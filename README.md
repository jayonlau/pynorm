# pynorm

We want to be able to use this tool to find some standard syntax errors and avoid some repetitive work.

# Quick Start

## Install dependencies

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Find any extra Spaces in the text

#The program looks for all the text files in the directory

#and prints out any files that contain excess space.

```
python3 pynorm.py $FILE_DIR
```
